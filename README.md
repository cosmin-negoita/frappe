# Frappe

Frappe is a React UI Kit I'm building as part of my React (and JS) learning journey. Everything (laughable) you see here is subject to improvement. Just bare with me.

In the meanwhile, you can see the build here: http://cosmin-negoita.github.io/frappe

Got some feedback to help me get on the right track? I'm all ears!
